## Optimizing-production-Lines

###
An automobile company plans to launch new production lines in the coming year, each of which will have the ability to produce certain types of cars. The information related to the cost of setting up each production line and the time capacity of each line is the first Excel sheet. Also, the production time of each food in minutes is in the second sheet.
The limitations of the problem include:

1-	Due to space and capital limitations, the company has the possibility of building a maximum of 3 production lines. Also, due to some restrictions, it is not possible to build production lines 4 and 5 at the same time.

2-	Due to the policy of maintaining market share, the company must sell at least 18,000 devices. Also, at least 4 car models should be produced.

3-	If it is decided to produce one type of car, at least 1500 units of that type should be produced.

4-	According to the contract with a construction company, the company is obliged to produce at least 1500 vans. If the request is not accepted, the company must pay a fine of 3.5 million dollars.

5-	According to market research, people are more interested in buying SUV cars. Therefore, it is necessary to allocate at least 63% of the production of the family class (all cars except pickups and vans) to cars of this class.

6-	Due to the existence of environmental conventions, the production of cars with high engine volume should be controlled. Therefore, the car manufacturer is obliged to produce three cars, Edge, Explorer and Mustang, which have 3600, 2400, and 7200 cc engines, in such a way that the total volume of these 3 models does not exceed 32,000 liters.

The linear programming model of the problem was obtained with the aim of maximizing the income in GAMS software.
